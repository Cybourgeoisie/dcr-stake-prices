# Decred Staking Price Association

This Python tool accepts the .csv created by the Decredition wallet to calculate all profits from staking, and creates a copy of the .csv with the prices on the day that the tickets were staked, including the profit generated.

This tool requires Decredition 1.2.0, which right now is in alpha testing. As of this writing, version 1.2.0 can be found in the [decred-binaries releases](https://github.com/decred/decred-binaries/releases/tag/v1.2.0-rc1).


## Usage

```
python dcr-stake-prices.py [path_to_original_filename.csv] [path_to_new_filename.csv]
```


## Data

The Decred price data is provided by [CoinMetrics.io](https://coinmetrics.io).
